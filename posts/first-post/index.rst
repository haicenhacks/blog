I'm going to use this as an introduction/explanation of what I want this to be. I do a lot of small projects, (Raspberry pi, arduino, etc) so I wanted to be able to share those (and provide documentation for myself).

Here is a short list of my hobbies:

- cybersecurity
- lock picking
- model trains
- arduino
- raspberry pi
- ham radio
